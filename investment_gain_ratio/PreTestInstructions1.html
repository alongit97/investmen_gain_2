<p>
  This study examines how people combine information in their attempt to decide whether products are profitable
  or not. You will be shown information cards, each representing a single case. On each card you will see an
  amount of investment a person made, and the outcome that resulted from that investment.
</p>   

<p>
  Your task is to compare investments and their outcomes in order to consider whether the investments are
  profitable or not. After 36 cards, we shall ask for your assessment of the profitability of investing in the product
  in question.
</p>

<p>
  All in all, you will be shown a total of 72 cases, in two lists of 36 pairs, with each list showing the results for one
  of two stocks. After the second list we shall also ask which stock you would prefer to invest in, using some
  extra money we shall give you for that decision.
</p>

<p>
  Please pay close attention to each of the cases. From time to time, we shall ask you whether the amount
  invested or the amount obtained in the most recent transaction exceeds a certain value. If you answer this
  question incorrectly two times, we shall void your participation in the study.
