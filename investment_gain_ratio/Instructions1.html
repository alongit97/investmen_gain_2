        This study examines how people combine information about buying and selling prices of stocks recommended
        by stockbrokers, in order to form an opinion about how good the brokers are. You will see information about
        investments in stocks. For every investment, you will know who gave the advice (broker A or broker B), how
        much money the investor put in, and how much that person got back when the same bundle of stocks was
        sold. Since these investments were made by different people, with different preferences, and at different times,
        the amounts, as well as the profits or losses would vary.
    </p>

    <p>
        To figure out how good an investment was, what matters most is the return—this means how much money
        people got back compared to what they put in. In particular, it is important to consider the ratio between selling
        and buying prices. To see why, let us look at two examples:
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Person A invests $5,000 and gets back $6,000.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Person B invests $50,000 and gets back $51,000.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both made a profit of $1,000, but they did not make the same investment. Person A made more money relative
        to how much they invested. Think of it this way:
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Person A earned $1,000 from $5,000 — that's a 20% return.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Person B earned $1,000 from $50,000 — that's only a 2% return.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, even though both people earned the same amount in dollars, Person A's investment grew a lot more
        compared to what they started with. That makes it a better investment.
