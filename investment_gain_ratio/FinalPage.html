    The buying cost (picked at random) is {{player.random_investment}} points and the selling price is {{player.random_gain}}
    points for a bonus of {{player.bonus}} points

    Considering the initial bonus of 120 points, this adds up to a bonus of {{total_bonus_points}} points.
    This bonus is worth {{bonus_pennies}} pennies. In addition, you got {{player.accuracy_value}} pennies 
    in the tests of the accuracy of your assessments of the profitability of the two markets, 
    making your final bonus {{payoff_plain}} pennies.
