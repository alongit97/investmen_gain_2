    <p>You have observed two different sets of buying/selling cases, which we will refer to as two separate "markets":</p>

    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Market 1:</span> In this market you reviewed 36 cases, where each case described an individual buying a stock for a
        specific amount, and the amount received when that stock was sold. All cases involved buying and selling of
        Stock A.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Market 2:</span> In this market you reviewed 36 cases, where each case described an individual buying a stock for a
        specific amount, and the amount received when that stock was sold. All cases involved buying and selling of
        Stock B.
    </p>


    <p>Now, you have an opportunity to earn a bonus. We start by giving you 120 extra points.</p>

    <p>
        We would like you to choose one of the two markets you were presented with during the experiment. Once you
        choose a market, we will draw at random one card from that market. Your bonus would be 120 points plus the
        selling price specified on that card minus the buying cost.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that your final bonus may be higher or lower than the initial 120 points, depending on the
        resultâ€”but it will always be positive. Your bonus will be converted into cash at a rate of one penny per 2 points,
        and added to your payment for participation.
    </p>
