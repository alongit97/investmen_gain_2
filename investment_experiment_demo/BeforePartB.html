        In the next section, you will review 36 cases again. This time, you will first see the
        outcome an individual received, and then, the investment he or she made. Each
        case follows this format:
    </p>

    <p style="color: blue;"><strong>Individual received outcome X.</strong></p>
    <p style="color: #cbb406;"><strong>After having made an investment Y.</strong></p>

    <p>
        Again, please pay attention to the numbers. Your task is to evaluate the relationship
        between the outcome and the investment. That is, the outcome resulting from a unit
        of investment. To remind you, at the end of the experiment, you will have the chance
        to use this information to earn a monetary bonus.

        Again, please pay attention to the numbers. Your task is to evaluate the relationship
        between the investment and the outcome. That is, the investment required per unit of
        outcome. To remind you, at the end of the experiment, you will have the chance to
        use this information to earn a monetary bonus.
