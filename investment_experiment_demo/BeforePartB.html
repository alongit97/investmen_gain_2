<h3>Instructions Before Series 2</h3>

<p>In the next section, you will, again, review 36 cases, each describing the specific outcome an
individual received after having made a certain investment. Each case follows this format:</p>

<p style="color: blue;"><strong>Individual received outcome X.</strong></p>
<p style="color: #cbb406;"><strong>after having made an investment Y.</strong></p>

<p>Again, please pay close attention to these pairs of values. To remind you, at the end of the
experiment, you will have the chance to use this information to earn a monetary bonus.</p>
