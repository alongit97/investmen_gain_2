    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    
    <p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in our study.</p>
  
    <p>
      This study examines how people learn from investment decisions made by others. To this end, you will be shown
      information cards, one at a time. On each card you will see an amount of investment a person made and the outcome
      that resulted from this investment.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Please pay attention to the numbers. Your task is to evaluate the relationship between investment amounts and their
      outcomes, that is, the investment/outcome contingency.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      After seeing 36 cards, we shall ask for your assessment of the investment/outcome contingency.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      It is important to pay close attention to the values shown on each card. Occasionally, 
      the presentation will pause, and you will be asked about the card you have just seen.
      If you answer incorrectly twice, your submission will be voided.
    </p>
  
    <p style="color: red;"><strong>Please don't forget to submit the HIT with a valid completion code</strong></p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">&gt;&gt; we won't be able to pay you otherwise</p>
