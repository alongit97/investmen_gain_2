    <p>Welcome</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in our study.</p>

    <p>
      This study examines how people learn from investment decisions made by others.
      To this end, you will be shown information cards, one at a time. Each card displays
      the amount of money someone invested on one side, and the outcome that resulted
      from that investment on the other side. Please pay attention to the numbers. Your
      task is to evaluate the relationship between the investment and the outcome. That is,
      the investment required per unit of outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      After seeing 36 cards, we shall ask for your assessment of the investment/outcome
      contingency.
    </p>

      To this end, you will be shown information cards, one at a time. Each card displays
      the outcome of an investment on one side, and the amount of money that was
      originally invested on the other. Please pay attention to the numbers. Your task is to
      evaluate the relationship between the outcome and the investment. That is, the
      outcome resulting from a unit of investment.

      It is important to pay close attention to the values shown on each card. Occasionally,
      the presentation will pause, and you will be asked about the card you have just seen.
      If you answer incorrectly twice, your submission will be voided.
