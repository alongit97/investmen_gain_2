    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    
    <p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in our study.</p>
  
    <p>
      This study examines how people learn from investment decisions made by others. To this end, you will be shown
      information cards, one at a time. On each card you will see an amount of investment a person made and the outcome
      that resulted from this investment.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Please pay attention to the numbers. Your task is to evaluate the relationship between investment amounts and their
      outcomes, that is, the investment/outcome contingency.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      After seeing 36 cards, we shall ask for your assessment of the investment/outcome contingency.
    </p>
  
    <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
      PLEASE NOTE:
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important that you read the cards carefully. We will stop the presentation occasionally and ask you to report
      the investment or outcome you have just seen.
      <strong>Your submission will be voided in case you misreport that value twice.</strong>
    </p>
  
    <p style="color: red;"><strong>Please don't forget to submit the HIT with a valid completion code</strong></p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">&gt;&gt; we won't be able to pay you otherwise</p>
