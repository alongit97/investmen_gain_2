    You have just observed 36 cases of the outcomes that were received by individuals who made 
    investments of varying amounts. Before we move on to the next part of the experiment, we would 
    like to assess your understanding of the situation.

    try to predict whether the situation is likely to result in a gain or a loss <u>for you</u>.

    <label><input type="radio" name="estimate_B" value="2"> Your <strong>outcome</strong> would be <strong>greater than</strong> the investment you made?<strong>(a small gain)</strong></label></label><br>
