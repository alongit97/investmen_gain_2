    <p>You have observed two different sets of investment/outcome cases, which we will refer to as two separate "markets":</p>

{% if session.config.investment_before_outcome %}
    <p><span class="highlight">Market 1:</span> In this market you reviewed 36 cases, where each case described an
        individual making an investment of a specific amount and the outcome they received
        following that investment.
    </p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Market 2:</span> In this market you reviewed 36 cases, where each case described an
        individual receiving an outcome of a specific amount and the investment they made
        prior to receiving that outcome.
    </p>

{% else %}
    <p><span class="highlight">Market 1:</span> In this market you reviewed 36 cases, where each case described an
        individual receiving an outcome of a specific amount and the investment they made
        prior to receiving that outcome.
    </p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Market 2:</span> In this market you reviewed 36 cases, where each case described an

    <p>Now, you have an opportunity to earn a bonus. We start by giving you 50 extra points.</p>

    <p>We would like you to choose one of the two markets you were presented with during the experiment. 
    Once you choose a market, we will draw at random one card from that market. 
    Your bonus would be the outcome specified on that card after the investment is deducted.</p>

    <p>Please note that your final bonus may be higher or lower than the initial 50 points, 
    depending on the resultâ€”but it will always be positive. Your bonus will be converted into cash at a rate of one penny per point, 
    and added to your payment for participation.</p>

    <h4>Which market do you prefer to invest in? (Market 1 or Market 2)</h4>
