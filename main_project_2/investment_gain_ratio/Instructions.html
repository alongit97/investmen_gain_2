        This study examines how people combine information about investments and the outcomes of those
        investments, to form an opinion about profitability. You will see information about different people's
        investments in stocks. For every investment, you will know whether the person in question invested in stock
        A or stock B, how much money was put in, and how much the person got back when the stock was sold.
        Since these investments were made by different people at different times, the amounts would vary.
    </p>

    <p>
        To figure out how good an investment was, what matters most is the return—this means how much money
        people got back compared to what they put in. In particular, it is important to consider the ratio between
        selling and buying prices. To see why, let us look at two examples:
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Person A invests $5,000 and gets back $6,000.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Person B invests $50,000 and gets back $51,000.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both made a profit of $1,000, but they did not make the same investment. Person A made more money
        relative to how much they invested. Think of it this way:
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Person A earned $1,000 from $5,000 — that's a 20% return.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Person B earned $1,000 from $50,000 — that's only a 2% return.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, even though both people earned the same amount in dollars, Person A's investment grew a lot more
        compared to what they started with. That makes it a better investment.
    </p>

    <p>Let's now look at two people who both lost $1,000, but following different investments:</p>


    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Person C invested $5,000 and ended up with $4,000.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Person D invested $50,000 and ended up with $49,000.
    </p>    

    <p>Even though they both lost $1,000, their failure was not the same.</p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Person C lost $1,000 out of $5,000 — that's a 20% loss.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Person D lost $1,000 out of $50,000 — that's only a 2% loss.
    </p>
    <p>    
        So, Person C's loss was much bigger relative to their investment. That means that Person C made a much
        worse investment compared to Person D, even though the dollar loss was the same.
    </p>
